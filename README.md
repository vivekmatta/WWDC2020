# WWDC20 Coding Challenge Submission

Welcome

This is my WWDC19 Coding Challenge Submission. It is a cool simulation of the Earth. Have fun while using! 

About this playground

I really love Astonomy. So I wanted a way to share my passion with everyone. 

<b>What is it</b>

This playground represents a simulation of Earth from an outer space perspective, incorporating abilities to manipulate rotational speed on its axis, location, and size. Using AVAudioFoundation, the Earth is transformed into an Audio Visualization Spectrum, reacting to the ambient audio track’s frequency levels. This creates a pulsating spectrum that allows the user to see Mother Earth in a brand new light. Using sliders and buttons provided by UIKit, the user can also manipulate the audio track’s play rate, volume, and ability to pause.
